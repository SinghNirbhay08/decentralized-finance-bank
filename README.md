# Decentralized Finance Bank

A decentralized banking system built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to create accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and check balances securely using smart contracts.

## Features

- **Create Account:** Users can create a new bank account with an account name, account number, initial deposit (ETH), and security PIN.
- **Deposit Funds:** Allows users to deposit ETH into their account.
- **Withdraw Funds:** Users can withdraw ETH from their account by providing a security PIN.
- **Check Balance:** Allows users to check the balance of their account using their account number and PIN.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum Blockchain**
- **Web3.js:** JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask:** Browser extension to interact with the Ethereum network.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for frontend design and logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)** and set up an Ethereum account.
- Ensure you have **[Ether](https://faucet.metamask.io/)** (ETH) for transactions if youâ€™re testing on a test network.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SinghNirbhay08/decentralized-finance-bank.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

3. Make sure you have an Ethereum provider (like MetaMask) connected to the network and properly configured.

4. Open the `index.html` file in a browser with MetaMask installed.

5. Interact with the DApp through the UI. Make sure you are logged into MetaMask and connected to the appropriate Ethereum network.

### Running the Project

This is a frontend DApp, and it's ready to use as soon as you open it in a browser with MetaMask:

1. Open the HTML file in a browser.
2. Connect MetaMask to your Ethereum network.
3. Interact with the decentralized bank by creating accounts, depositing/withdrawing ETH, and checking balances.

### Smart Contract Deployment

The smart contract for the decentralized bank is already deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. For now, it's linked to the following contract address:

```text
Contract Address: 0xB86B7A677F070cedeB8e1352De0072Ba5c18F086
```

If you'd like to deploy it to another network, you can update the `contractAddress` in the JavaScript code accordingly.
